To correctly style the list items regardless of nesting, use the `:nth-of-type` pseudo-class. This selector counts only elements of a specific type, preventing the counter reset that occurs with `:nth-child`. 

```css
li:nth-of-type(odd) {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

li:nth-of-type(even) {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

This ensures that the styles apply consistently to odd and even list items, even within nested structures.
